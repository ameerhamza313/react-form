React Form Validation

Description:
The React Form Validation project is a robust and efficient solution for implementing client-side form validation in React applications. It provides developers with a simple and customizable way to validate user input in forms, ensuring data integrity and enhancing the overall user experience.

Key Features:
1. Input Validation: The library offers a wide range of built-in validation rules for common input types such as text fields, email addresses, phone numbers, dates, and more. It helps prevent users from submitting invalid or incorrect data.

2. Custom Validation Rules: Developers can easily define custom validation rules to meet specific business requirements, tailoring the form validation to suit their unique needs.

3. Real-time Feedback: The validation is performed in real-time as users fill out the form, providing instant feedback to users about the validity of their inputs. Errors and warnings are displayed dynamically, helping users correct mistakes promptly.

4. Form-wide Validation: In addition to individual input validation, the library supports form-wide validation, allowing developers to check the relationship between multiple form fields and apply complex validation rules.

5. Error Messaging: When validation errors occur, clear and user-friendly error messages are displayed next to the affected form fields, guiding users on how to correct the issues.

6. Validation Events: Developers have the flexibility to trigger validation events based on different user interactions, such as onBlur, onChange, or onSubmit, to strike the right balance between user experience and performance.

7. Accessibility: The library is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that form validation messages are available to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

8. Seamless Integration: With a straightforward integration process, developers can quickly incorporate the validation functionality into their existing React applications without a steep learning curve.

9. Error Prevention: The library not only identifies and displays validation errors but also helps prevent invalid form submissions, leading to a smoother user experience and reduced form submission errors.

Tech Stack:
- React: The core of the project is built on React, leveraging its component-based architecture for easy integration and modularity.
- JavaScript: The library is written in modern JavaScript, utilizing ES6+ features to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- JSX: JSX is used to create expressive and declarative UI components for form elements and validation messages.
- CSS: Styling is implemented using CSS to ensure a clean and visually appealing presentation of form elements and error messages.
